# Anti-Sleeping-Alarm
An Arduino project that uses an **IR eye blink sensor** to detect driver drowsiness.  
When the driver’s eyes remain closed beyond a set limit, the system triggers a **buzzer alarm** to prevent accidents.

## How to Run
1. Open `anti_sleeping_alarm.ino` in Arduino IDE.  
2. Connect your Arduino board and upload the code.  
3. Build the circuit as shown in `circuit_diagram.png`.  
4. Power the system — the alarm will sound if drowsiness is detected.
